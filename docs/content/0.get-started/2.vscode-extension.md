# Pinceau VSCode

Pinceau provides an extension that gives additional features providing the last mile of DX.

## Tokens definitions

The extension will detect where each of your tokens actual value is defined (including the tokens that gets overwritten by [another layer](/advanced/multi-layer)).

That allows Pinceau to create links when you hover token values in your editor, and point you to the token definition path when using `Ctrl+Click` on the token.

## Missing tokens warnings

The extension will detect when you are using a token, both with `'{your.token}'`{lang="ts"} and `$dt('your.token')`{lang="ts"} syntaxes.

If the origin of the token cannot be found in one of your loaded configurations, then this token will be marked as a warning in your editor `Problems` section.

You can modify the level of the problem, or completely disable it from your VSCode settings.

## Color hints

When a token value is detected as being a color, or a reference to a color token, then Pinceau will display a color hint in your IDE.

## More to come!

This extension started as a week-end project, and ended up being very fast to implement.

I'm sure we can go a lot further polishing the DX with it!
