# What is Pinceau?

Pinceau aims at making styling more playful in Vue components.

It offers incrementally adoptable solutions that integrates nicely with existing Vue SFCs.

The objective is to take all the `<style>` related logic out of your `<script>` tags.

## How does it work?

Pinceau is a :icon{name="vscode-icons:file-type-vite"} [Vite plugin](/get-started/installation#vite) that reads and transform your Vue components.

It also comes with a :icon{name="vscode-icons:file-type-nuxt"} [Nuxt module](/get-started/installation#nuxt), that supports [Nuxt Studio](https://nuxt.studio).

It starts with a [configuration file](/configuration), that supports:

- [Design Tokens](/configuration/design-tokens)
- [Responsive Tokens](/configuration/responsive-tokens)
- [Media Queries](/configuration/media-queries)
- [Utilities Properties](/configuration/utilities-properties)

Once you are all setup with your theme, you're all set to use the **styling features**:

- [The `css()` function](/styling/css-function) will provide you autocomplete on all your tokens.
- [The tokens helper](/styling/tokens-helper) will help you use your tokens in any context.
- [Computed styles](/styling/computed-styles) can help you build style-based component props supporting your tokens.
- [Variants](/styling/variants) can help you build advanced and reusable responsive style props.
