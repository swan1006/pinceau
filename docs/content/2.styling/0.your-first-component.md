# Your first component

Let's walk through the creation of your first component fully built with Pinceau.

```vue
<style lang="ts">
css({
  '.my-button': {
    backgroundColor: '{color.blue.1}',
    padding: '{space.4}'
  }
})
</style>
```

As you can see in this code, Pinceau uses `<style lang="ts">`{lang=vue} blocks and the `css()`{lang=ts} function.

These blocks are parsed by Pinceau to provide both `static` and `runtime` CSS features.

That `css` function calls is not really running in the `runtime` context of your app, but instead will smartly split between the CSS that can be static, and the features that relies on runtime stylesheet evaluation.

The CSS function is a very convenient tool to write CSS in the same language as the rest of your component.

In addition to that, it also is the entry door for all the rest of Pinceau's **existing** and **upcoming** features.

## Static CSS

Even if you do not want to use runtime features, `css()` stays an excellent way to write your styling.

::my-button
---
color: green

Hello World
::

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">

</script>

<template>
  <button class="my-button">
    <slot />
  </button>
</template>

<style scoped lang="ts">
css({
  '.my-button': {
    display: 'inline-block',
    borderRadius: '{radii.xl}',
    transition: 'box-shadow .1 ease-in-out',
    color: '{color.white}',

    '@dark': {
      background
    }
  }
})
</style>
```
