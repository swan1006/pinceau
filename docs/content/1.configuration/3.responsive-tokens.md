# Responsive tokens

Responsive tokens are a specific kind of tokens that takes the reponsive styling the other way around.

For some token values, it might be useful that instead of defining at which breakpoint the token is used from a component definition, to define from the token definition which value it should use at which breakpoint.

Let's create a responsive token that use a light color in dark mode and a dark color in light mode:

```ts
export default defineTheme({
    primary: {
      initial: '{color.blue.900}',
      dark: '{color.blue.50}'
    },
    blue: {
      50: '#C5CDE8',
      100: '#B6C1E2',
      200: '#99A8D7',
      300: '#7B8FCB',
      400: '#5E77C0',
      500: '#4560B0',
      600: '#354A88',
      700: '#25345F',
      800: '#161E37',
      900: '#06080F',
    },
})
```

As seen in the example, a **Responsive token** is recognized by defining a token value as an object that includes `initial` and another key from your media queries.

`initial` key will refers to: your default color scheme + mobile media query `(min-width: 0px)`

Responsive tokens supports:
  - All your [media queries](/configuration/media-queries) in `media` key of your tokens.config
  - `dark` and `light` native keys
  - [Tokens references](/configuration/tokens-config#tokens-references)
  - Both `native` and `class` color scheme modes
